                    Dear God,
Today I lift up someone truly special to You.
Thank You for her life, for the light she brings to the world,
for her strength, her laughter, and the kindness she shares.

As she steps into a new year, I pray You surround her with peace 
the kind that quiets the noise and steadies the heart.
Guide her toward joy that lasts and growth that feels right,
even in the quiet places where no one sees.

Keep her safe in all she does,
and bless the people and paths she walks with grace.
Help her feel deeply valued, not just today, but every day.

And even from a distance,
may she always know she is thought of with warmth,
and wished nothing but good things.

Amen..</h3>
